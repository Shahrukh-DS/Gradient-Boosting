# Gradient Boosting Experiments

This repository contains code for experiments with **Gradient Boosting** using the **Scikit-learn** library. The experiments focus on the impact of:
1. Learning Rate on model performance.
2. Number of Estimators on accuracy.
3. Combined effects of Learning Rate and Number of Estimators.

## Dataset
We use the `Diabetes` dataset from `Scikit-learn`, which predicts the progression of diabetes.

## Features
- **Experiment 1:** Learning Rate vs. Accuracy
- **Experiment 2:** Number of Estimators vs. Accuracy
- **Experiment 3:** Combined Learning Rate and Number of Estimators

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gradient-boosting-experiments.git
